# Contributing to "Docs as Code" Manifesto

We love your input! We want the Manifesto to set out a "Docs as Code" mentality. Please help us bring the Manifesto into a usable form by,

- Contributing your ideas
- Reporting any gaps
- Becoming a maintainer

Report your idea using [issues](https://github.com/twodrops/docs-as-code-manifesto/issues) or if you would like to suggest concrete changes, raise a PR directly using the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr). That is,

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository to merge the changes in your fork

Discuss your ideas with us directly on Slack @ [#docs-as-code](https://writethedocs.slack.com/archives/C72NZ18FR) channel.
